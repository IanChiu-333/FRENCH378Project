Before French colonization, the island, which includes modern day Haiti and the Dominican Republic, was first inhabited and settled by indigenous people called Taino and Ciboney. Their economies mainly consisted of farming, fishing, interisland trading as well as lucartive gold mining. However, Spanish colonization and enslavement resulted in the near total elimination of the native poulation. 
Haiti is a Caribbean country that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. In 1697, France colonized what is now modern day Haiti and renamed it to Saint-Domingue. After the Haitian Revolution between 1791 and 1804, Haiti won its indepedence from France.
